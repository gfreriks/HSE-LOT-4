WHERE in the Patient System is the archetype active?
The Patient System is the location of the topic with the patient as focus. It helps to define what the Archetype is about.
When the topic is ECG the localisation for Body Part is the heart and the BodyFunction: Elctrical systems of the heart.
In the case of an ENTRY archetype the exact location of an Act (process) most likely will be modeled in the WHAT:NamedObject branch where the participating entity os modeled.
In the case of a CLUSTER archetype this can be sued to indicate what part of the Patient System is the topic for that archetype.

Preferably use the WHO ICF as primary coding system.

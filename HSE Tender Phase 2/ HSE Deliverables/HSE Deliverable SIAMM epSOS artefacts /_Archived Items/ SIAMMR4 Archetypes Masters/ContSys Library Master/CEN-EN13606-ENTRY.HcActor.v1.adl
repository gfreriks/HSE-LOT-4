WHERE in the Patient System is the archetype active?
The Patient System is the location of the topic with the patient as focus. It helps to define what the Archetype is about.
When the topic is ECG the localisation for Body Part is the heart and the BodyFunction: Elctrical systems of the heart.
In the case of an ENTRY archetype the exact location of an Act (process) most likely will be modeled in the WHAT:NamedObject branch where the participating entity os modeled.
In the case of a CLUSTER archetype this can be sued to indicate what part of the Patient System is the topic for that archetype.

Preferably use the WHO ICF as primary coding system.

This Cluster Model defines:
	•	the generic Class name from the Target Reference Model
	•	the name given to that generic class from the TrM
	•	the context of the artefact when it is used to document events during the care treatment cycle
	•	the use of the rate fact. Is it defined for use for persistence, querying or presentation

In the case of an ENTRY class from the TrM the possible FUnctions are: Order, Execution, Observation of results and Assessment of any procedure.

All the choices in this ToA branch of they generic semantic pattern define the specific pattern to be used.">

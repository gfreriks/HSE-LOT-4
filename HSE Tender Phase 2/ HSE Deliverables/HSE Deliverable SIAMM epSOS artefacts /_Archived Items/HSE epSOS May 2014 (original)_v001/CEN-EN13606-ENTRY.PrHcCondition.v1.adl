It is used in the SIAM Main ENTRY Pattern.
Its purpose is to describe the nature of the artefact: reference model used, class of the reference model, name of the class, binding to ContSys, sub-pattern used, intended use of the artefact, context in which the artefact will be used, etc.
This Cluster Model defines:
	•	the generic Class name from the Target Reference Model
	•	the name given to that generic class from the TrM
	•	the context of the artefact when it is used to document events during the care treatment cycle
	•	the use of the rate fact. Is it defined for use for persistence, querying or presentation

In the case of an ENTRY class from the TrM the possible FUnctions are: Order, Execution, Observation of results and Assessment of any procedure.

All the choices in this ToA branch of they generic semantic pattern define the specific pattern to be used.">

CLUSTER model that codes for the Allowed range in an artefact for a Number.
It is a course grained number that the AOM allows to be specified and sets allowed numbers.
It specifies a constraint at design time.
A constraint that can be refined in Templates and at run-time depending on circumstances.
E.G
  Systolic Blood Pressure
Number 120 mmHg
Magnitude: 0-1000
Results like -10 or 2000 are NOT allowed.

The number/result as a fraction = Nominator / Denominator, both as Integers
E.g. 2 out of 5, 1 on a scale 1 out of 10,
When multiplied by 100 it is equal to Percentage.
Percentage is defined in HL7 UCUM

Sensitivity is essentially how good a test is at finding something if it's there. It is a measure of how often the test will correctly identify a positive. For example, a blood test for a virus may be as high as 99% or more - meaning that for every 100 infected people testing, 99 or more of them will be correctly identified. This is a good figure to take note of, but doesn't necessarily reflect a test's true effectiveness, as will become apparent.
Specificity is a measure of how accurate a test is against false positives. A sniffer dog looking for drugs would have a low specificity if it is often lead astray by things that aren't drugs - cosmetics or food, for example. Specificity can be considered as the percentage of times a test will correctly identify a negative result. Again, this can be 99% or more for good tests, although a particularly unruly and easily distracted sniffer dog would be much, much lower.

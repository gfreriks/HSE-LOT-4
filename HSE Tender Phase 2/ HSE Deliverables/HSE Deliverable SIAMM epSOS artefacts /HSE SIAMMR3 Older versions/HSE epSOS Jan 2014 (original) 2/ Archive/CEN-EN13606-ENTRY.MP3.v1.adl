WHERE in the Patient System is the archetype active?
The Patient System is the location of the topic with the patient as focus. It helps to define what the Archetype is about.
When the topic is ECG the localisation for Body Part is the heart and the BodyFunction: Elctrical systems of the heart.
In the case of an ENTRY archetype the exact location of an Act (process) most likely will be modeled in the WHAT:NamedObject branch where the participating entity os modeled.
In the case of a CLUSTER archetype this can be sued to indicate what part of the Patient System is the topic for that archetype.

Preferably use the WHO ICF as primary coding system.

Sensitivity is essentially how good a test is at finding something if it's there. It is a measure of how often the test will correctly identify a positive. For example, a blood test for a virus may be as high as 99% or more - meaning that for every 100 infected people testing, 99 or more of them will be correctly identified. This is a good figure to take note of, but doesn't necessarily reflect a test's true effectiveness, as will become apparent.
Specificity is a measure of how accurate a test is against false positives. A sniffer dog looking for drugs would have a low specificity if it is often lead astray by things that aren't drugs - cosmetics or food, for example. Specificity can be considered as the percentage of times a test will correctly identify a negative result. Again, this can be 99% or more for good tests, although a particularly unruly and easily distracted sniffer dog would be much, much lower.

Again, this can be 99% or more for good tests, although a particularly unruly and easily distracted sniffer dog would be much, much lower.">
